### Hey there! 👋

I’m **Eduard Barrera**, a **Software Engineer & Fullstack Developer** based in Colombia 🇨🇴.

I design and build **scalable and maintainable software systems**.

If an idea or problem appears, chances are I’ll architect it, build it, and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Docker**. I focus strongly on **clean architecture, SOLID principles, and code quality**.

I work end‑to‑end: from system design to deployment, including **real‑time systems** and **AI integrations (LLMs)**.

I’ve built multiple fullstack projects, but my favorite is **SummitTalk**, a real‑time messaging platform focused on low latency and scalability.

#### Fun Facts:

* I care a lot about clean code and architecture
* I enjoy playing table tennis
* Bilingual: Spanish / English
* **Hobbies:** gym, learning, building side projects
